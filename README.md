## 📖 About the I Ching

The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is an ancient divination text that has been used for centuries as a source of wisdom and guidance. It is based on the concept of yin and yang, represented by broken and solid lines, which are combined to form 64 hexagrams. Each hexagram has a unique meaning and offers insight into the energies at play in a given situation.

## 🚀 How It Works

The application simulates the traditional method of casting I Ching hexagrams using yarrow stalks or coins.

1.  **Casting the Lines:** The app randomly generates six numbers, each representing a line in the hexagram. The numbers 6, 7, 8, and 9 correspond to the different types of lines (yin, yang, changing yin, changing yang).
2.  **Determining the Hexagrams:**
    *   The six lines form the **primary hexagram**, which reflects the present moment.
    *   If any of the lines are "changing" (a 6 or a 9), they transform into their opposite, creating a **secondary (or evolving) hexagram**. This second hexagram provides insight into how the situation is likely to unfold.
3.  **Displaying the Reading:** The app looks up the corresponding hexagrams in the `i_ching_data.json` file and displays the relevant texts and images.
4.  **AI Interpretation:** If an OpenAI API key is provided, the app sends the user's question and the details of the reading to the OpenAI API. It then displays the AI-generated interpretation, which offers a modern perspective on the classical reading.
