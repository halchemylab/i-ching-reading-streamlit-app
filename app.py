            The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is an ancient text for divination and wisdom. To consult it, you approach it with a sincere question. The oracle responds with a **hexagram**‚Äîa figure of six lines‚Äîthat mirrors the cosmic energies at play in your situation.

            - **Solid lines (Yang)** represent the creative, active principle.
            - **Broken lines (Yin)** represent the receptive, yielding principle.

            At times, a line may be 'changing,' indicating a dynamic aspect of the present moment. This transformation reveals a second hexagram, offering insight into how the situation may evolve. This app is a vessel for this ancient dialogue, helping you cast a reading and contemplate its meaning.
