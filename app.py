            3.  **The Reading:** The app will simulate the traditional method of casting coins to generate six lines, which form a **hexagram**. 
            4.  **Changing Lines:** Some lines may be "changing," which means they are in a state of transformation. These lines are especially significant and create a second hexagram, showing the direction your situation is heading.
            5.  **Interpretation:** You will receive the texts for your primary hexagram, any changing lines, and your transformed hexagram. You can then request a modern interpretation from an AI assistant.
